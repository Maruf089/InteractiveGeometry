                    <h5>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h5>
                    <p>Document Object Model - also known as the DOM is the full, parsed representation of the HTML. A
                        tree structure that records all of the connections between the nodes, along with the HTML's
                        content and characteristics.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h5>
                    <p>We can access already created elements using JavaScript. To access or get elements we use
                        different selectors like-
                    <ol>
                        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                        <li> getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>getElementsById()</li>
                        <li>querySelector()</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                        <li>setAttribute()</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>What is event bubble?</h5>
                    <p>The element that triggered the event that took place is where it begins. Then, until it reaches
                        the html element, it bubbles up to each of its parent elements.
                        In the case of a form field, the parent form would receive the event first, followed by any
                        containers or divs the form was in,then the body, the html element, the document, and finally
                        the window.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h5>
                    <p>A reference to a piece of executable code that is supplied as an argument to other code
                        We can pass more than one callback functions into the parameter of a function, just like we can
                        pass more than one variable.
                        It guarantees that the function will execute only once the task has been finished, never
                        earlier. It creates asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps them safe from errors.
                    </p>
